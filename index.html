        <h3>Triangle</h3>
        <p>A triangle is a closed shape with 3 angles, 3 sides, and 3 vertices. A triangle with three vertices says P, Q, and R is represented as △PQR. It is also termed a three-sided polygon or trigon. In this mini-lesson, we will explore everything about triangles, which are commonly seen around us. If you observe the shape of signboards and your favorite sandwiches it forms the shape of a triangle.</p>

        <h3>Parts of Triangle</h3>
        <p>A triangle consists of various parts. It has 3 angles, 3 sides, 3 vertices.</p>

         <h3>Properties</h3>
         <p>Every geometry shape has fixed properties to identify the relationship between different sides and angles. In this section, we will study the important triangle properties listed below.</p>
         <ol>
           <li>1. Triangle has three sides, vertices, and angles.</li>
           <br><br>
           <li>2. The angle sum property of a triangle states that the sum of the three interior angles of a triangle is always 180°. Such as in any given triangle PQR, angle P + angle Q + angle R = 180°.</li>
           <br><br>
           <li>3. Triangle inequality property states that the sum of the length of the two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side.</li>
           <br><br>
           <li>4. As per the Pythagorean theorem, in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides i.e., (Hypotenuse² = Base² + Altitude²).</li>
           <br><br>
           <li>5. Exterior angle property of a triangle states that the exterior angle of a triangle is always equal to the sum of the interior opposite angles.</li>
         </ol>
